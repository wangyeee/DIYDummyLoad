# DIYDummyLoad
A primitive DC dummy load with STM32F103.

## Components
1. STM32F103RC MCU.
2. LMV321 OpAmp and IRFB3607PBF N channel MOSFET for the load.
3. LMV324 as input buffer for the STM32 ADC.
3. ILI9163C LCD (Thanks to [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com) for the [GFX Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library))
